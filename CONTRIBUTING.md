# How to Contribute

This project in under [The GNU General Public License v3.0](LICENSE). We accept contributions via
GitHub pull requests. This document outlines some of the conventions related to development
workflow, commit message formatting, contact points and other resources to make it easier to get
your contribution accepted.

## Certificate of Origin

By contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). This
document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a simple statement that you, as a
contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution. See the [DCO](DCO) file for details.

Contributors sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a Signed-off-by line to
commit messages. For example:

```text
This is my commit message

Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

Git even has a -s command line option to append this automatically to your commit message:

```shell
git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
```

If you have already made a commit and forgot to include the sign-off, you can amend your last commit
to add the sign-off with the following command, which can then be force pushed.

```shell
git commit --amend -s
```

We use a [DCO bot](https://github.com/apps/dco) to enforce the DCO on each pull request and branch
commits.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
1. Read the [readme](README.md) for build and test instructions
1. Play with the project, submit bugs, submit patches!

## Contribution Flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

1. Create a branch from where you want to base your work (usually master).
1. Make your changes and arrange them in readable commits.
1. Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below).
1. Push your changes to the branch in your fork of the repository.
1. Make sure all tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.
1. Submit a pull request to the original repository.

## Comments

You should add appropriate comments to all new methods and structures. Additionally, if an existing
method or structure is sufficiently modified, you should add comments to it if it doesn't have any
already or update them if they do.

The goal of comments is to make the code more readable and grokkable by future developers. Once you
have made your code as understandable as possible, add comments to make sure future developers can
understand (A) the responsibility of piece of code within Rash's architecture and (B) why it was
written as it was.

The blog entry below explains more the whys and hows of this guideline.

## Commit Messages

We follow a rough convention for commit messages that is designed to answer two questions: what
changed and why. The subject line should feature the what and the body of the commit should describe
the why.

```text
doc: Add issue templates

I thought it would be nice to have templates for issues. This way, bug reports
or new requests have a normalized pattern and they'll become easier to process.
```

We can define the format more formally as follows:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <what changed>
<BLANK LINE>
<why this change was made>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
{% if issue related %}
Resolves: #{issue.id}
{%- endif %}
```

You can find what values area could take see
[gearr/.commitlintrc.json](https://github.com/pando85/gearr/blob/master/.commitlintrc.json).

The first line is the subject and should be no longer than 70 characters. The second line is always
blank, and other lines should be wrapped at 80 characters. This allows the message to be easier to
read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

**Important!** Any submitted pull request needs to have commit messages validated according to that
specification. To avoid nasty surprises, we set up a `commit-msg` hook that validates your commit
message before the commit actually takes place.

You need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for this hook to work. If
you're working on Linux, make sure you can run it with non-root permissions! More info
[here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).

Finally, keep in mind that you need to set up the hooks before you commit for the first time. It's
really easy, as `pre-commit` takes care of the whole thing. You just need to ensure you run
`pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg` at least once before committing.
